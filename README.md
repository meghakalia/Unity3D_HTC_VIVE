# Visual & Tactile Synchrony Perception in Metaverse

Haptics in Mixed Reality can provide more immersive experience enabling many downstream tasks in robotics, entertainment, health, education, etc. 
However, there can be system latencies in haptic feedback (e.g. a robotics system), leading to asynchronous haptic & visual feedback in metaverse. Human perceptual system can calibrate and ignore the latency upto certain threshold. 
This project aims to find what is the threshold of this visual-tactial latency tolerance in metaverse. The study can guide the development of future robotics/haptics systems targeted towards Mixed Reality applications. 


## Description
The project uses HTC vive for VR display and 3D Sense Touch Haptic device.
